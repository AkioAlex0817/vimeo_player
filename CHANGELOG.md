## [0.1.3] - Great functionality improvement.

### Added:
* Responsive full screen.
* Rewind
* Rewind double tap

### Fixed:
* When expanding to full screen, the status bar is hidden. If the user still opened it, then soon it will disappear.
* When exiting full screen mode, the playback moment is saved. Now goes to the video page instead of the home page.
* The source code is now open
